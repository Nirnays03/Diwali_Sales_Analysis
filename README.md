#  Diwali Sales Analysis

Hi there!  This is a project I worked on to improve my skills in data analysis using Python. I came across a guided tutorial on YouTube, and instead of just following along, I tried to understand everything deeply and add my own insights along the way.

The idea was to analyze Diwali shopping data and see what kind of patterns or trends we could find ‚Äî especially things that might help a business improve their festive season sales.

# Tools I Used

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas** for data cleaning and exploration
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for creating charts

# Dataset

The data came from a Diwali sales dataset that includes customer details like:
- Gender
- Age group
- state tier
- Product category
- Amount spent

It seemed like a good choice to practice real-world business analysis.


# Data Cleaning Steps

- Removed empty values (`NaN`)
- Dropped a few irrelevant columns (like `Status`, `Unnamed: 10`)
- Converted data types (like changing "Amount" to integer)
- Cleaned up column names to make them easier to work with


# What I Explored

I tried answering questions like:

- Who spends more: men or women?
- Which age group buys the most during Diwali?
- What products are most popular?
- Which states have the highest sales?

I visualized some of the findings below ‚¨áÔ∏è

## Spending by Gender

# Key Insights

- Women aged 26‚Äì35 spent the most during Diwali
- states like uttarpradesh, maharashtra and Karnataka saw the highest sales
- Categories like Clothing and Food were the top performers

These insights could help businesses target the right audience during the festive season.

# What I Learned

- Got more confident using Pandas and Seaborn
- Realized how small data cleaning issues can affect the whole analysis
- Learned to ask the right business questions, not just play with code

# Next Steps

If I had more time, I‚Äôd love to:
- Create a Power BI or Tableau dashboard from this
- Try some basic customer segmentation
- Maybe turn this into a little report or blog post
