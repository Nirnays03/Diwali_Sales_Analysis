Diwali Sales Analysis

Introduction

In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Diwali sales data to understand customer behavior, purchasing trends, and key factors influencing sales. The goal was to extract meaningful insights that can help businesses optimize marketing strategies and improve sales performance.

Data Collection & Preprocessing

I worked with a dataset containing 11,251 sales records with various customer attributes like gender, age, marital status, location, occupation, product category, and order details.

Data Cleaning & Manipulation

To prepare the data for analysis, I:

Removed irrelevant columns (Status, Unnamed1)

Handled missing values by dropping rows with null values

Converted data types (e.g., Amount column changed to integer for accurate calculations)

Renamed columns for better readability

Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Using Seaborn and Matplotlib, I created various visualizations to analyze trends and patterns.

1. Customer Demographics

Gender Analysis:

Female buyers were the majority and had a higher purchasing power than male buyers.

Age Group Analysis:

Most buyers belonged to the 26-35 years age group.

Women in this age group contributed significantly to total sales.
